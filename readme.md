Stub for a paper kickstarter repository.  (Because I'm trying to standardize my workflow, and getting a bit sick of copying over the same makefile, date updater script, etc. from project to project) **WIP**


Need to write a script that asks for the canonical name and title (or just creates the canonical name out of the title, whev.) and then creates git repos and dropbox folders (dropbox folder structure also needs to be standardized, e.g., a source dump folder---ideally one which automatically shoots anything dumped there over to zotero so I can just drop things in from ios, but that's probably a part 2 thing.) and then templates it all out.
